# A Mind Forever Voyaging

## What is this?

This repository contains a reconstructed development sequence for the Infocom game A Mind Forever Voyaging.

## Where did it come from?

The sequence has been reconstructed from the contents of the repositories [zilf-heritage/amfv-r77](https://github.com/zilf-heritage/amfv-r77), [zilf-heritage/amfv-r79](https://github.com/zilf-heritage/amfv-r79) and [zilf-heritage/amfv-latest](https://github.com/zilf-heritage/amfv-latest).

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if the development of this game can be continued from where it left off in order to fix known bugs.
