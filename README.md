# A Mind Forever Voyaging (Development Sequence)

## What is this?

This repository contains a reconstructed development sequence for the Infocom game A Mind Forever Voyaging.

## Where did it come from?

This repository was forked from [zilf-heritage/amfv](https://github.com/zilf-heritage/amfv).

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if the development of this game can be continued from where it left off in order to fix known bugs.
